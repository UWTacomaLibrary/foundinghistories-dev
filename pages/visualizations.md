## Transcript Visualization Demo

This is a demonstration of a visualization using the [Oral History as Data](https://uidaholib.github.io/oral-history-as-data/) tool. 

To highlight oral history as valuable textual data and its potential for digital scholarship research, we show here a visualized transcript of the [Greg Tanbara](/items/foundingstories76.html) oral history interview. The topics discussed in the narration are color-coded. On the prism bar, click on a color representing a topic of interest to view relevant discussions throughout the interview. Use the drop-down menu that appears to filter by topic. On the [analyzed transcript](/transcripts/tanbara.html?q=), click on the timestamp to listen to the select section of the interview.

More transcripts may be analyzed via the tool in the future depending on support for a next phase of the *Founding Stories* project and as resources allow.
