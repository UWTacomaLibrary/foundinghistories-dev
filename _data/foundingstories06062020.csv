Claudia Gorbman interview,"Gorbman, Claudia","Williams, Charles Thomas",2018-04-05,"April 5, 2018",2018,Faculty,Liberal Studies; School of Interdisciplinary Arts and Science,"In this interview, Claudia Gorbman reflects on the transformations at University of Washington Tacoma since its establishment, comparing the earlier, more idealistic years focused on interdisciplinary education to the more recent growth in size and bureaucratic procedures. She describes the adventurous spirit of a new frontier that marked the beginning years.      The session begins with her explaining her professional trajectory and the difficult decision to choose UW Tacoma over the tenured position she had held at Indiana University Bloomington for 15 years. On the subject of gender imbalance among the founding faculty, Gorbman remarks on the respectful treatment she has received from her peers and the force of her only female colleague on the faculty, Judy Stevens-Long. Speaking about her own scholarship, Gorbman regrets taking an &quot;elitist&quot; approach, stating that her views have shifted toward the end of her tenure at UW Tacoma--from focusing on global recognition to becoming more community-oriented.      The conversation then turns to the Global Honors Program, which Gorbman directed, and she recognizes the work of her successor, Divya McMillin. She praises her students in the early years, who were typically older, professional students, noting their diligence and insight. She then talks about starting the Tacoma Film Society with UW Tacoma professor Anthony D'Costa, his wife Janette Rawlings, and Beckie Etheridge at the University's Media Services. The interview concludes with Gorbman's comments on how much the University's trajectory has deviated from the original vision as a result of rapid expansion and general attitudes toward the humanities and interdisciplinary studies.","Claudia Gorbman (b. 1948) is professor emerita of film studies at the University of Washington Tacoma. She retired in 2015 after teaching for 24 years at UW Tacoma. Gorbman received her bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees all from University of Washington. After earning her PhD in Romance Languages and Literature in 1978, she became a tenured professor of comparative literature at Indiana University Bloomington and taught there for a total of 15 years. Intrigued by the opportunity to return to the Pacific Northwest and to build a university from the ground up, she joined the founding faculty of UW Tacoma in 1990. At UW Tacoma, she has directed the Global Honors Program and co-founded the Tacoma Film Society, which held monthly film screenings. She is the 2009 recipient of UW Tacoma's Distinguished Research Award. Her book, Unheard Melodies: Narrative Film Music (1987), is a seminal title in the literature on film and media music.     Gorbman and her partner, Pam Keeley, were one of the first same-sex couples to wed in Seattle when Washington state legalized gay marriage in December 2012. She is the daughter of UW professor and renowned zoologist Aubrey Gorbman.","Gorbman, Claudia--Interviews; Film teachers--Washington (State)--Tacoma; University of Tacoma--History",,Global Honors; interdisciplinary; interdisciplinary education; Judy Stevens-Long; Deborah Stansbury Sunday; Debra Friedman; Pat Spakes; nontraditional students; the whole U; tri-campus; Tacoma Film Society; Tacoma Film Festival; film studies; comparative literature; gender; Jack Keating; Indiana University Bloomington; Nathan Hale High School; water rights; Puyallup Tribe; Puget Sound Energy; LNG,United States--Washington (State)--Tacoma; United States--Washington (State)--Seattle; United States--Indiana--Bloomington,Oral histories,The oral history interview with Claudia Gorbman was part of the &quot;Founding Stories&quot; phase of the UW Tacoma Oral History Project.,English,eng,University of Washington Tacoma Oral History: Founding Stories,UWTOH201803,"To request a high resolution or uncompressed reproduction, or to obtain permission to use any portion of this item, contact University of Washington Tacoma Library.

Suzanne Klinger interview,"Klinger, Suzanne","Wadland, Justin",2017-12-14,"December 14, 2017",2017,Staff,Library,"In the interview, Klinger describes how she came to work at UW Tacoma Library. She relates that the recruitment of staff was concurrent with the faculty curriculum planning conference in spring 1990. She recounts how, in the early days, the library worked closely with its Seattle counterpart, borrowed from its established systems, and designed new procedures to circulate materials across the campuses.      The conversation then turns to interdepartmental relationships. Klinger notes that the library operated somewhat independently from the campus administration and how that resulted in feelings of animosity, as well as challenges faced by the founding librarian, Deborah Stansbury Sunday, who happens to be African-American. The interview then shifts from the lack of diversity in the initial faculty to transformations at the library and of Klinger's position. To Klinger, the establishment of UW Tacoma's physical presence aided a sense of rootedness and connection to the local community. She remarks that the early student body did not reflect the diversity of the local population and on the difficulty to amend that. She then ponders how the institution might help the homeless population or alleviate the impact on gentrification its development has caused.     In the final portion of the interview, Klinger shares her perspective on mentorship, naming a few past student employees at UW Tacoma Library, including Brian Bannon, who is now the Commissioner of the Chicago Public Library system. She reflects on how technology has transformed the practice and meaning of her work. While regretting the University's regression toward less interdisciplinary and more traditional degree offerings, she expresses hopes in an increased commitment to social justice and fairness on both the school's and the library's part.","Suzanne Klinger was born in 1957 in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. She received a liberal arts college education at Gettysburg College and majored in Ancient Greek. She began her early career as a teaching assistant at a private school established for at-risk youth, primarily serving students who came from inner-city Philadelphia. It was there that she discovered a possible professional path in librarianship, and she went on to complete her MA in librarianship at University of Chicago in 1984. In Chicago, she witnessed issues inherent in and associated with the urban environment and developed her concern for social justice. She also met her partner, who is from Seattle.      By the time she relocated to Tacoma in 1989, she had already worked at libraries at the University of Illinois at Chicago, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, and Duke University. In Tacoma, after a brief period working in the Pierce County Library System, Klinger joined founding librarian Deborah Stansbury Sunday to become the second employee at the University of Washington Tacoma Library. She has been here for 28 years, and she is now the Head of Reference and Research Services, overseeing the reference desk. Her subject specialty areas include Communication, History, Sociology, and Urban Studies.","Klinger, Suzanne--Interviews; Academic librarians--Washington (State)--Tacoma; University of Tacoma.

Michael Sullivan interview,"Sullivan, Michael","Wadland, Justin",2017-09-21,"September 21, 2017",2017,Community member,City of Tacoma; Historic Preservation Office; Artifacts Consulting,"In the interview, Sullivan describes the building of the University of Washington Tacoma campus, addressing themes of architecture, historic preservation, urban design, and warehouse district revitalization. He recalls working in the capacity of the city's historic preservation officer to review the campus location and facilitate its construction. In addition, together with fellow architect Valerie Sivinski at their firm Artifacts, he advised on building renovations as a conservator.     The bulk of the interview includes a discussion on how UW Tacoma came to be placed in its downtown location. Sullivan details the involvement of esteemed architect Charles Moore and his myriad thoughtful, intellectually grounded design ideas: elevated sidewalks converted from loading docks, pavement patterns reminiscent of railroad tracks, parchment-colored concrete floor that references the place's industrial origin and new academic purpose. Sullivan further elaborates on the decision to respect the historic Prairie Line, the terminus of the Northern Transcontinental Railroad, and the significance to treat it as a central organizing point to the layout of the campus.     Sullivan then comments on the transformation of downtown since the late 1980s, with its new purpose in education and culture. He muses on Dale Chihuly's rise as a prominent artist. The interview concludes with Sullivan's remarks on how the political force formed by Booth Garner, Brian Ebersole, and Lorraine Wojahn aided the growth of UW Tacoma; he praises the university's contribution to economic justice and suggests its future role in equity issues within the city.","Born in Seattle, Washington, in 1950, Michael Sullivan moved around with his family from Spokane to Oregon and Texas. He studied theater at UCLA in the 1960s and later obtained his master's and doctorate degrees in history from Western Washington University and University of Washington. Upon completion of his PhD program, he worked as the historic preservation officer for City of Tacoma and soon after came to head the newly established Cultural Resources Division from 1990 until 1995. In this period, Tacoma's Warehouse District underwent renovation to transform into the University of Washington Tacoma campus, paralleling a &quot;cultural renaissance&quot; in the city that saw the renewal of downtown historic buildings, such as the Pantages Theater and Union Station. Sullivan played a key role in these restoration projects.     In 1997, after he left City of Tacoma, he co-founded Artifacts Consulting, Inc., an architectural conservation firm. He is now the the principal and historian of Artifacts Consulting. And he also serves as a Washington State advisor to the National Trust for Historic Preservation and chairs its Public Policy Committee.    He has taught a course on the history of Tacoma and the Pacific Northwest at the University of Washington Tacoma for 20 years, from 1994 until 2015. He helped to develop the Tacoma Community History Project, a digital archival collection housed at the UWT Library.","Sullivan, Michael, 1950-Interviews; Historic preservation--Washington (State)--Tacoma; University of Washington Tacoma--History",,Charles Moore; Dale Chihuly; Artifacts; Prairie Line; Northern Transcontinental Railroad; Union Station; Historic Preservation Office; Warehouse District; Urban Waters,United States--Washington (State)--Tacoma,Oral histories,The oral history interview with Michael Sullivan was part of the &quot;Founding Stories&quot; phase of the UW Tacoma Oral History Project.,English,eng,University of Washington Tacoma Oral History: Founding Stories,UWTOH201701,"To request a high resolution or uncompressed reproduction, or to obtain permission to use any portion of this item, contact University of Washington Tacoma Library.

Michael Honey interview,"Honey, Michael K.","Williams, Charles Thomas",2017-10-04,"October 4, 2017",2017,Faculty,Liberal Studies; School of Interdisciplinary Arts and Science,"In the interview, Honey recounts his student life and early career. He begins with early influences from his own &quot;union family&quot; and postwar Michigan, where workers were well-represented by strong unions, such as the United Automobile Workers. He describes his college experience at Oakland University, where he met his mentor and professor, Henry Rosemont, who opened his eyes to the situation of the Vietnam War and led him to register as a conscientious objector. He recalls the 1967 Detroit riot and speaks of Martin Luther King as a recurring theme in his life and career.      Honey then discusses the period after college, when he went to the South and became actively involved in the civil rights movement--working on cases of Angela Davis and others. He talks about how these experiences fueled his desire to attend graduate school at Howard University and Northern Illinois in order to study and write about African-American history, labor, and civil rights in the South.     In the second half of the interview, Honey discusses how he arrived at University of Washington Tacoma. He recalls his efforts building relationships with the community and prominent Tacoma figures like Tom Dixon, a civil rights leader and founding director of the Tacoma Urban League. He notes the success of programs at such locations as the Washington History Museum and the Allen AME Church. As a founding faculty member, he helped to shape the first courses offered at UW Tacoma, and he incorporated music into his history courses, drawing connections to Pete Seeger, the Highlander Folk School, and others. On the importance of community relationship, he highlights decisions over the years to hire faculty who were invested in the population surrounding the UW Tacoma campus. As the session nears its end, he remarks on the challenges of having to build an institution while teaching and conducting scholarship simultaneously and laments over the waning legislative support for higher education.","Michael Honey was born in 1947 in Lansing, Michigan. He grew up in Williamston, Pontiac, and Grand Rapids in Michigan, and Toledo, Ohio. His father was a World War II veteran and urban planner-turned professor who was born into an English farming family in Michigan. His mother came from a French-Canadian working-class family in Detroit. This background had a profound influence on Dr. Honey's views, his affinity for union workers, and his later academic interests. Honey attended Oakland University, then an experimental, humanities-centered college in southeast Michigan, from 1965 to 1969. Amid the escalation of the Vietnam War, he received approval for his conscientious objector status when he graduated.      After college, he went to Kentucky and subsequently spent six years in Memphis to serve as the Southern Director of the National Committee Against Repressive Legislation. He completed his graduate degrees at Howard University in Washington, D.C., and at Northern Illinois University, where he focused his research on labor history and developed his first book, Southern Labor and Black Civil Rights. He has since authored several other books, including Going Down Jericho Road: The Memphis Strike, Martin Luther King's Last Campaign.     He came to University of Washington Tacoma in 1990 as a founding faculty member. Currently holding the Fred and Dorothy Haley endowed professorship of Humanities, he teaches African-American and labor history. During his time at UW Tacoma, he has also served as the Harry Bridges Endowed Chair of Labor Studies.","Honey, Michael K.--Interviews; National Comittee against Repressive Legislation (U.S.); Labor movement--United States; Civil rights--United States; University of Washington Tacoma--History",,Martin Luther King Jr.; League of Revolutionary Black Workers; March of Washington; civil rights; Vietnam War; conscientious objectors; labor; National Committee Against Repressive Legislation; Southern Conference Educational Fund; Herbert Aptheker; William Kunstler; Carl Braden; Highlander Folk School; Pete Seeger; Harry Bridges; ILWU Local 23; Evergreen State College; diversity,United States--Washington (State)--Tacoma; United States--Kentucky--Louisville; United States--Michigan--Detroit; United States--Tennessee--Memphis; United States--Michigan--Lansing,Oral histories,The oral history interview with Michael Honey was part of the &quot;Founding Stories&quot; phase of the UW Tacoma Oral History Project.,English,eng,University of Washington Tacoma Oral History: Founding Stories,UWTOH201702,"To request a high resolution or uncompressed reproduction, or to obtain permission to use any portion of this item, contact University of Washington Tacoma Library.

Samuel Parker interview,"Parker, Samuel K.","Williams, Charles Thomas",2018-01-31,"January 31, 2018",2018,Faculty,Liberal Studies; School of Interdisciplinary Arts and Science,"In this interview, Samuel Parker reminisces about the early days of University of Washington Tacoma and explains the decisions that eventually led to a more departmentalized approach to academic programs. He notes an increased preoccupation with accountability and management structures on the institution's part.     The interview begins with Parker pointing out reasons that attracted him to UW Tacoma, including the unique interdisciplinary curriculum and the rare opportunity to build an institution from scratch. He describes the dynamic among the initial 13 faculty and their legacy of resistance against the compartmentalization of the University, especially following the creation of a psychology concentration under the first chancellor, Vicky Carwein. He also recalls characteristics of the students who were first to enroll at UW Tacoma and praised their industry and eagerness to learn. The session then turns to the University's relationship with the local community, and Parker mentions joining the Pierce County Arts Commission. He relates this to the revitalization of Downtown Tacoma through the arts. He discusses the work of Charles Moore, remarking that Moore had designed an Indian style garden--charbagh--for the UWT campus based on his previous work on Mughal gardens and Indian gardens.     The last part of the interview concentrates on the development of today's Master of Arts in Interdisciplinary Studies, in which Parker played an instrumental role. He recalls the process that began in 1990 with the idea for a master's in liberal studies, which developed into a possible inter-program (IP) master's and eventually materialized as the MAIS in 2001. Parker concludes by citing the program to represent what he would like to see in the future of UWT--something unique and interdisciplinary.","Samuel Parker is a founding faculty member at the University of Washington Tacoma. He teaches cultural studies, with a focus on Asia and the Pacific, in the School of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences (formerly Liberal Studies). In April 1990, he was among the 13 founding faculty who planned the University's initial curriculum over a three-day conference. Over the years, he has been dedicated in leading the charge to establish an interdisciplinary master of arts program, which finally materialized as Master of Arts in Interdisciplinary Studies in 2001.      Before joining UW Tacoma, he was a visiting lecturer in anthropology at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, Illinois. He received his PhD in anthropology from University of Chicago in 1989. He completed his bachelor's and two master's degrees at University of Hawaii and taught art history there over several summers. His fieldwork has taken him to Bali and India, where he studied the visual culture of the Hindu temple and its contemporary construction and use, particularly in contexts such as cultural tourism.","Parker, Samuel K.--Interviews; Pierce County Arts Commission; Interdisciplinary approach in education; Curriculum planning; University of Washington Tacoma--Hisotry",,Pierce County Arts Commission; Charles Moore; charbagh; Mughal gardens; Vicky Carwein; nontraditional students; MAIS; Global Honors; interdisciplinary education,United States--Washington (State)--Tacoma; United States--Washington (State)--Seattle,Oral histories,The oral history interview with Samuel Parker was part of the &quot;Founding Stories&quot; phase of the UW Tacoma Oral History Project.,English,eng,University of Washington Tacoma Oral History: Founding Stories,UWTOH201801,"To request a high resolution or uncompressed reproduction, or to obtain permission to use any portion of this item, contact University of Washington Tacoma Library.

Michael Allen interview,"Allen, Michael","Williams, Charles Thomas",2018-02-21,"February 21, 2018",2018,Faculty,Liberal Studies; School of Interdisciplinary Arts and Science,"In this interview, Michael Allen describes what it was like to be a faculty member at University of Washington Tacoma at the founding of the campus. He remarks on how the interdisciplinary bent--which is less pronounced in today's more-structured curriculum--reflected an intellectual goal shared among the initial faculty members. He explains the freedom and flexibility this allowed, citing fondly his experience conducting scholarship at the intersection of history, folklore, music, and rodeo.      The interview then shifts to UW Tacoma's relationship with the local community. Allen points out the issue of fairness, noting that Tacoma was the largest metropolitan area on the Pacific coast that did not have a state college, and therefore, he says, the community embraced the arrival of UW Tacoma, which offered essentially open admission and a pathway to higher education. He recalls a preference for faculty candidates' investment in the community in earlier recruitments, when whether or not they lived locally in the South Sound was important.      In the concluding section of the interview, Allen traces the trajectory of UW Tacoma, projecting that it will become increasing similar to regional state schools. He attributes this to democracy, the forces of politics, and the fact that most Americans are more interested in applied degrees than liberal arts. He welcomes this future and intends to create, as much excellence as possible, while broadening access.","Michael Allen (b. 1950) was born and raised in Ellensburg, Washington. His mother was Jewish and taught high school English literature. His father had left the Mormon church in Pocatello, Idaho, and owned an ice cream shop, which adjoined Michael Allen's childhood home. Allen graduated from Ellensburg High School in 1968 and served with the U.S. Marines Corps in Vietnam. He returned to his hometown to study history at Central Washington University (then Central Washington State College), earning his bachelor's degree in 1974. He subsequently moved to Missoula and completed his MA in history at the University of Montana in 1977. He then spent three years working on the Mississippi River as a towboat deckhand, oil tankerman, and cook. This experience framed his specialization in the Mississippi Valley as a historian and planted seeds for his PhD thesis and first book, Western Rivermen, 1763-1861: Ohio and Mississippi Boatmen and the Myth of the Alligator Horse, which was published in 1990.      He returned to the Pacific Northwest to work on his PhD at University of Washington and earned his degree in 1985. Prior to joining the founding faculty of University of Washington Tacoma in 1990, he had taught history at Eastern Montana College in Billings, Deep Springs College in California, and Tennessee Technological University. He has written a number of books and co-authored A Patriot's History of the United States: From Columbus's Great Discovery to the War on Terror (2004), which became a New York Times Bestseller.     He inherited an ardent interest in rodeo from his father and established the Ellensburg Rodeo Hall of Fame in 1997, serving as its founding president for seven years. In addition, Allen has continued his enthusiasm for magic--a childhood passion--and performed magic shows on the UW Tacoma campus.","Allen, Michael, 1950- --Interviews; History teachers--Washington (State)--Tacoma; Interdisciplinary approach in education; Curriculum planning; University of Washington Tacoma--History",,Mississippi River; Vietnam War; Jack Keating; core curriculum; interdisciplinary curriculum; diversity; Washington State Historical Society; William Gerberding; Grand Valley State University; Evergreen State College,United States--Washington (State)--Tacoma; United States--Washington (State)--Seattle; United States--Washington--Ellensburg,Oral histories,The oral history interview with Michael Allen was part of the &quot;Founding Stories&quot; phase of the UW Tacoma Oral History Project.,English,eng,University of Washington Tacoma Oral History: Founding Stories,UWTOH201802,"To request a high resolution or uncompressed reproduction, or to obtain permission to use any portion of this item, contact University of Washington Tacoma Library.

Liz Heath interview,"Heath, Elizabeth","Wadland, Justin",2018-05-15,"May 15, 2018",2018,Community member,University of Washington Tacoma Advisory Board; Sound Nonprofits; Communities in Schools of Lakewood,"Liz Heath starts the session by explaining her involvement in the late 1980s with the Tacoma-Pierce County Economic Development Board (EDB) and the South Puget Sound Higher Education Council, where she worked with Ryan Petty, then the director of EDB, on the project to found UW Tacoma. She recalls the community activism that successfully brought public higher education to the South Puget Sound region. She discusses the assessments of community needs, the vision for a liberal arts curriculum that would offer a practical degree to place-bound students, and the decision made by the Washington Higher Education Coordinating (HEC) Board to eventually select University of Washington as the institution to make this happen. The session shifts to the political aspect of establishing UW Tacoma. Heath describes the legislative support the University received, naming, in particular, Brian Ebersole, former Washington State Speaker of the House, and majority leader Dan Grimm. The conversation continues with a glimpse into the initial interviews for the founding faculty, which Heath attended as a member of the UW Tacoma Advisory Panel. In the concluding part of the session, noting her encounters with students and alumni of UW Tacoma, Heath states that this is perhaps the most important work she has done in her life. The interview ends with Heath’s reflection on various perspectives on community that, she says, are shaped by the environment.","Liz Heath (b. 1940) is a nonprofit consultant whose work centers around community involvement in Tacoma, Washington. She is currently the principal at Sound Nonprofits, a consulting firm that offers guidance and tools to small and mid-sized nonprofits. Prior to that, she was the founder and executive director of The Nonprofit Center (1999-2011), which developed resources for nonprofits in the South Puget Sound region, and the principal at Morgan Heath Consulting (1986-2003). She holds a BA (1962) from Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin. In the late 1980s, Heath served on the Tacoma-Pierce County Economic Development Board (EDB) and worked on bringing public higher education to the South Sound. The EDB assembled the South Puget Sound Higher Education Council, a community group, to provide a local perspective and identify community needs. In 1988, Washington State's Higher Education Coordinating (HEC) Board designated University of Washington--rather than Washington State University or other contenders--to be the university to open a branch campus in Tacoma. Heath then served on UW Tacoma’s advisory panel, which was involved in the selection of the founding faculty, and she became the panel’s vice chairwoman in 1993.","Health, Liz, 1940- --Interviews; Sound Nonprofits (Firm); Nonprofit Center (Firm); Consulting firms--Washington (State); Nonprofit organizations--Washington (State); Advisory boards--Washington (State); University of Washington Tacoma--History.",,South Puget Sound Higher Education Council; Tacoma-Pierce County Economic Development Board (EDB); community outreach; community involvement; urban revitalization; urban development; higher education; Sam Smith; Washington State University; Bill Gerberding; Ryan Petty; Rod Hagenbuch; Fred Haley; Urban Waters; place-bound students; nontraditional students,United States--Washington (State)--Tacoma; United States--Washington (State)--Seattle,Oral histories,The oral history interview with Liz Heath was part of the “Founding Stories&quot; phase of the UW Tacoma Oral History Project.,English,eng,University of Washington Tacoma Oral History: Founding Stories,UWTOH201804,"To request a high resolution or uncompressed reproduction, or to obtain permission to use any portion of this item, contact University of Washington Tacoma Library.

Brian Ebersole interview,"Ebersole, Brian","Wadland, Justin",2018-07-27,"July 27, 2018",2018,Government official; Community member,University of Washington Tacoma Advisory Board,"In this interview, Brian Ebersole recounts his involvement in the establishment of the University of Washington Tacoma, which coincided largely with his time as Washington State House Majority Leader. He remembers first hearing about the idea in 1987 and credits fellow legislator Dan Grimm for having by that point explored access to public higher education in the South Sound for over a decade. He points out the need in Tacoma, citing that it is an underserved, blue-collar city in relation to Seattle. He then explains the mechanism of founding a state branch campus and how Grimm, being the Chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, had significant leverage to make it happen. Placing UWT in the context of the revitalization of Downtown Tacoma, he connected the founding of the campus to the Save Our Nation movement, which resulted in the restoration of the historic Union Station. The second half of the session turned toward other community initiatives such as the contributions of the Tacoma-Pierce County Economic Development Board (EDB), which Ebersole said carried out their efforts largely independently. In addition, he mentions Kelso Gillenwater and David Zeeck, publishers of The News Tribune, as some of the key players. In the concluding part of the interview, Ebersole shares his opinion on broadening access to public education, emphasizing the need for inclusiveness. Finally, he reflects on the future direction of UW Tacoma, mentioning Urban Waters as an ideal example of collaboration between the state, city, and the University to fulfill local needs and advance research.","Brian Ebersole (b. 1947) came to Tacoma, Washington, in 1972 and worked with the Tacoma Public Schools as a dropout prevention specialist for 10 years. He served in the Washington State House of Representatives from 1983 to 1996, during which he was Speaker of the House from 1993 to 1995, after first serving as Majority Leader. He was the mayor of Tacoma from 1996 to 2000 and subsequently the president of Bates Technical College until 2003. During his time in public office, he contributed to the revitalization of Downtown Tacoma, where the new Washington State History Museum opened in 1996, and the historic Union Station was rehabilitated and converted to a federal courthouse by 1992. In the late 1980s, he worked with Representative Dan Grimm, who was then the Chair of the Ways and Means Committee, to advocate for access to public higher education in Tacoma. He was part of the community group South Puget Sound Higher Education Council, which Ebersole calls the “candy factory backroom board,” referring to its chair Fred Haley and Tacoma’s Brown & Haley candy factory. Following the establishment of the University of Washington Tacoma, he served on its advisory board from 1996 to 2002. He was UWT’s first commencement speaker. Ebersole, now retired, opened a gallery called Art Above in 2018 on Pacific Avenue in Tacoma.",University of Washington Tacoma--History; Tacoma School District #10--Employees; Mayors--Washington (State)--Tacoma; Legislators--Washington (State),,Urban Waters; urban development; Norman Dicks; Herb Simon; Dan Grimm; Save Our Station; Union Station; Fred Haley; South Puget Sound Higher Education Council; higher education; place-bound students; nontraditional students; Bill Gerberding; Richard L.

She also reflects on her experience earning her bachelor’s degree at UW Tacoma as a working student and student parent. The session begins with her trajectory starting her career in the Morgan Hill Unified School District in Morgan Hill, California, and later at the College of Education at UW Seattle, before working and completing her degree at UW Tacoma. Contreras mentions faculty colleagues such as Marcy Stein and Belinda Louie who shared her path moving from the UW College of Education to UW Tacoma. She points to a strong sense of comradery when staff from different academic programs worked closely alongside each other in the small quarters of the Perkins Building, where the university operated until 1997. As the sole staff member of the Education Program when it was first established, Contreras had a wide array of responsibilities. She discusses working at outreach and recruiting events, interfacing with educators in the community, and her sense of pride and belonging in the Education Program. She recalls working with students—majority female and professional teachers—to navigate the challenges negotiating between graduate school, personal life, and teaching. In the later part of the interview, Contreras reflects on periods of growth and distress during her time at UW Tacoma, which corresponded with the different seasons in the university’s history. She emphasizes the priority to serve students and help them succeed, which she says is the most rewarding aspect of her work at UW Tacoma.","Sara Contreras (b. 1955) is currently a program administrator at the UW Tacoma Center for Equity and Inclusion. In the early 1990s, she worked to help establish University of Washington Tacoma’s Education Program (which became the School of Education in 2016) and has since played a key role in the program’s development—working to support students needs and recruitment—until 2008. She grew up in Morgan Hill, California, where she gained prior work experiences in the Morgan Hill Unified School District. When she moved to Seattle in the early 1980s, she worked at the College of Education at UW Seattle, where she simultaneously began college coursework. She finished and earned her bachelor’s degree at UW Tacoma in 1995.","Contreras, Sara--Interviews; Stein, Marcy; Louie, Belinda Yun-ying; Teachers--Reruiting--Washington (State)--Tacoma; University of Washington.

Dan Grimm interview,"Grimm, Dan","Wadland, Justin",2018-07-20,"July 20, 2018",2018,Government official; Community member,Pierce County,"At the start of this interview, Dan Grimm sheds light on the origins of the idea of a public university in the South Sound, which began in the 1970s. He explains the structure of higher education in the state of Washington, stating that it was aligned with the demographics more than 100 years ago. He explains how the population changes overtime have especially impacted the South Puget Sound region, and that the resulting disparity in education opportunities became a genesis for the founding of the University. Grimm recounts his roles on the House Higher Education Committee, when he started to advocate for university campuses in the area, stretching from Everett, along the east side of Lake Washington, and down to Tacoma. He discusses the revitalization of Downtown Tacoma and the restoration of the Union Station, crediting former Representative Jim Salatino for starting the Theater District. Grimm proceeds to discuss the political advantages and obstacles he and his colleagues in the legislature faced in the early stages of trying to establish a branch campus in Tacoma, and he recounts the dramatic turn of events when Sam Smith, who was in favor of branch campuses, became the new president of Washington State University and took a helicopter tour of the city. In the second half of the interview, Grimm goes into more detail about steps to place the UW Tacoma campus in Downtown and to create the South Puget Sound Higher Education Council. In closing, Grimm shares his opinions on the future direction of UW Tacoma and his perspective on state funding for higher education in Washington.","Dan Grimm (b. 1949) represented Puyallup, Washington, in the state House of Representatives for six terms from 1977 to 1988, and he left the legislature just before the opening of the University of Washington Tacoma. He began this career at age 24 in 1973 as a staff member in the House Higher Education Committee, before he became the director of the non-partisan policy office of the House. When he was elected, he served as the vice chairman and later chairman of the Higher Education Committee. He continued to be involved in higher education matters when he served as the Caucus Chair and then the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee for three terms. During this time, he was a strong and influential advocate for educational opportunities in the Puget Sound area, especially Tacoma. For instance, he worked with former Representative and Tacoma mayor Brian Ebersole and prominent businessman Fred Haley to establish the South Puget Sound Higher Education Council, representing community interests. He also was key to securing state funding for the restoration of Union Station and the construction of the Washington State History Museum. When he left the legislature in 1988, he became the State Treasurer and served two terms. He is currently the Deputy Executive and Chief Operating Officer for Pierce County.","Grimm, Dan, 1949- --Interviews; Legislators--Washington (State); South Puget Sound Higher Education Council; Ebersole, Brian; University of Washington Tacoma--History",,South Puget Sound Higher Education Council; higher education; place-bound students; nontraditional students; urban development; Bill Gerberding; Kelso Gillenwater; News Tribune; Washington State Legislature; House Ways and Means Committee; Higher Education Coordinating (HEC) Board; Bill Chance; Donna Kerr; Brian Ebersole; Chuck Collins; Theater District; Union Station; Glenn Terrell; Sam Smith,United States--Washington (State)--Tacoma; United States--Washington (State)--Seattle; United States--Washington (State)--Olympia; United States--Washington (State)--Everett; United States--Washington (State)--Puyallup,Oral histories,The oral history interview with Dan Grimm was part of the &quot;Founding Stories&quot; phase of the UW Tacoma Oral History Project.,English,eng,University of Washington Tacoma Oral History: Founding Stories,UWTOH201808,"To request a high resolution or uncompressed reproduction, or to obtain permission to use any portion of this item, contact University of Washington Tacoma Library.

He explains how the experience growing up in Tacoma and watching it suffer from urban decay compelled him to rally for investment in the city. He talks about how he leveraged his relationships with individuals such as George Weyerhaeuser—with whom he attended Lowell Elementary School—and former Seattle mayor Paul Schell to renew real estate in the city. He recalls his involvement in the powerful Executive Council for A Greater Tacoma with Gary Reed, Frank Shrontz, Erivan Haub, Goerge Russell, and others.

Michael Kalton interview,"Kalton, Michael","Williams, Charles",2018-05-24,"May 24, 2018",2018,Faculty,Liberal Studies; School of Interdisciplinary Arts and Science,"In this interview, Michael Kalton shares his experience as a founding faculty member at University of Washington Tacoma, shedding light on the tight-knit initial faculty, the growth of the institution overtime, and relationships with the university administration and local community. He begins by tracing his own academic background and explaining how, as a specialized expert in Korean Neo-Confucianism, he had come to choose an interdisciplinary, flexible career at UW Tacoma. He characterizes the dynamic among his first colleagues as natural, easy, and without a sense of hierarchy. He praises the nontraditional student body in the early years and remarks on how the University was concerned about diversifying the faculty, noting Michael Honey as a strong advocate. He goes on to explain the problems with scaling up interdisciplinarity and how that became an issue as the University grew. In the second half of the interview, Kalton recalls in more detail his motivation for organizing the faculty, which led him to establish the Faculty Assembly. While the University was backed by strong, high-level support from the South Sound community, he admits that he and his colleagues were overall too absorbed in building the institution to devote much to community outreach and developing relationships. He recalls his time as the director of the Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences program, as well as his academic interests in tackling the natural sciences from a religion and philosophy perspective. Closing the interview, Kalton reflects on UW Tacoma’s inevitable direction toward departmentalization, diverging from the innovative, liberal arts approach he and many others had envisioned and hoped for. He concludes that his tenure at UW Tacoma was a dream job representing something he truly believed in.","Michael Kalton (b. 1940) is a scholar of Korean Neo-Confucianism and a founding faculty member of University of Washington Tacoma. He was a Jesuit for 12 years, during which he completed his master’s degree in Greek and a licentiate in philosophy at St. Louis University. After teaching Greek and philosophy at a Roman Catholic Seminarian in Korea for three years, he became interested in East Asian cultures and worldviews. In 1970, he started his doctorate program at Harvard University, and there he met his wife, Margaret Kalton. By the time he completed his PhD, a joint-degree in Comparative Religion and East Asian Languages and Civilizations, in 1977, he had a two-year-old son, Max. He and his family then moved to Kansas, where he became a tenured professor of East Asian religions at Wichita State University and taught for 12 years. His daughter, Annaka, was born there in 1979. In 1990, he was offered professor positions at both University of Southern California and at University of Washington Tacoma. He chose the latter, more interdisciplinary option. At UW Tacoma, he founded the Faculty Assembly and chaired the organization for two terms. He was also the director of the Interdisciplinary Arts and Science program from 1996 to 2000. He retired from his 34 years of teaching in 2011. He has translated four books, including To Become a Sage: The Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning (1988) and The Four-Seven Debate: An Annotated Translation of the Most Famous Controversy in Korean Neo-Confucian Thought (1994). He co-authored the book Principles of Systems Science (2015) with George Mobus, UW Tacoma professor emeritus of computer science. He has received many honors in his career, including the International T'oegye Studies Award in 1987 and UW Tacoma’s first Distinguished Teaching Award.","Kalton, Michael--Interviews; Jesuits--Washington (State)--Tacoma; University of Washington Tacoma--Faculty; University of Washington Tacoma--History",,Jesuit; Confucianism; religion; philosophy; Korea; interdisciplinarity; Interdisciplinary education; faculty governance,United States--Washington (State)--Tacoma; United States--Washington (State)--Seattle; United States--Kansas--Wichita,Oral histories,The oral history interview with Michael Kalton was part of the &quot;Founding Stories&quot; phase of the UW Tacoma Oral History Project.,English,eng,University of Washington Tacoma Oral History: Founding Stories,UWTOH201806,"To request a high resolution or uncompressed reproduction, or to obtain permission to use any portion of this item, contact University of Washington Tacoma Library.

Robert Crawford interview,"Crawford, Robert","Williams, Charles",2018-05-01,"May 1, 2018",2018,Faculty,Liberal Studies; School of Interdisciplinary Arts and Science,"In this interview, Rob Crawford reflects on his involvement in building the University of Washington Tacoma. He describes the various roles he had, including faculty member, chair of the Faculty Assembly for three years, and cofounder of the Washington State Religious Campaign Against Torture. Drawing on his teaching experience at Evergreen State College, he compares experimental models and approaches to an interdisciplinary curriculum. In the first part of the session, Crawford shares his memory of the founding faculty and the first graduating classes. He notes that the students were older and brought with them professional and life experiences, which enabled a sense of collaboration between faculty and students. He recognizes the academic freedom he enjoyed at UW Tacoma, which has allowed him to flexibility design and trailer his teaching. He discusses a sample of his courses, including topics on the AIDS epidemic, the Holocaust, peace and justice, and human rights, and how he has cultivated his cross-disciplinary interests at UW Tacoma as a political scientist, historian, and cultural theorist. He also touches on the creation of the Master of Arts in Interdisciplinary Studies and the Global Honors programs. The interview then turns to faculty relationship with the administration. Crawford looks back at his experience working with UWT’s first chancellor Vicky Carwein, as well as with the Faculty Senate and other faculty organizations in Seattle and Bothell. He laments the institution’s relentless demands for growth, especially in terms of numbers. Continuing with this thought, he expresses the dissonance he felt with his early vision of UWT as a place for innovation in education, noting as well the limits of having interdisciplinarity as the only parameter.Crawford concludes the interview by naming teaching, curriculum development, and institution building as the three most rewarding aspects of his work at UWT. At the same time, he shares his concerns and frustrations about the direction of the institution.","Rob Crawford is a founding faculty member and professor emeritus at the University of Washington Tacoma School of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences. His academic interests span the fields of political science, history, and cultural theory. He is a human rights activist and a Faculty Associate with the UW Center for Human Rights. He founded the Washington State Religious Campaign against Torture in 2007 and has continued to facilitate it. In 1960, Crawford was a first-year student at Whittier College, a liberal arts college in Southern California. He was involved in protests against the Vietnam War, and later, intrigued by the birth of the new country, he went to Ghana and conducted part of his undergraduate studies at University of Ghana. He completed his PhD in political science at University of Chicago in 1974 and his postdoctoral work at Northwestern University. Before moving to Washington in 1986, he had taught in the Chicago area and at Boston University. He joined the UW Tacoma founding faculty from Evergreen State College, which influenced his approach to coordinated studies and innovations in teaching.

James Brown interview,"Brown, James F., 1935-","Williams, Charles",2018-05-29,"May 29, 2018",2018,Faculty,Liberal Studies; School of Interdisciplinary Arts and Science; Academic Affairs,"At the start of this session, Jim Brown recalls the unique interview process to recruit founding faculty at the University of Washington Tacoma and the curriculum planning meeting that took place later, in April 1990. He discusses the risks and unknowns involved in the adventure of building a new institution, noting his initial hesitation toward accepting the position. He shares his impression on the initial group of faculty assembled at the historic Perkins Building, remarking on the diverse academic backgrounds, interests, and personalities, as well as a strong sense of mutual respect for one another. The interview session then moves into the topic of leadership and faculty relationship with the administration. Brown recounts the somewhat unexpected departure of former dean Jack Keating, which led to Brown’s own involvement in the University’s administration and a national search that resulted in Vicky Carwein becoming the new chancellor. In the second half of the interview, Brown discusses the move to the permanent campus and some of the oppositions against UW Tacoma during this time. He characterizes the students in the early years as dedicated and eager to learn. He delves further into the evolving culture and structure on campus, noting a shift under former chancellor Vicky Carwein’s leadership. Toward the end of the interview, Brown expresses the importance of outreach, praising former chancellor Debra Friedman’s commitment to fostering community relationships, as well as commenting on the efforts to diversify the campus population, particularly faculty and staff.","James F. Brown (b. 1935) is professor emeritus at the University of Washington Tacoma School of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences. He earned his master’s degree as a Jesuit in philosophy and theological studies. He completed his PhD in philosophy at New York University in 1974. Employed by the State of New Jersey, he taught at the New Jersey City University, as well as at Seton Hall University and Saint Peter's University. In this period, his interest in interdisciplinary studies grew, and he was involved in curriculum planning and redesign. He and his family moved from New Jersey to Tacoma, Washington, when he joined a cohort of UW Tacoma founding faculty in 1989. During his tenure at the University, he was a professor, scholar, and administrator. He served as the interim director for Liberal Studies for one year and Associate Dean for Academic Programs for four years. He was active in the community and was a board member of the Tacoma Art Museum for two terms and of the Greater Tacoma Community Foundation. He retired in 2000.","Brown, James F., 1935--Interviews; University of Washington Tacoma--Faculty; University of Washington Tacoma--History",,Vicky Carwein; Jack Keating; Donna Kerr; Debra Friedman; higher education; liberal education; interdisciplinary education; academic administration; academic affairs; diversity; community engagement,United States--Washington (State)--Tacoma; United States--Washington (State)--Seattle,Oral histories,The oral history interview with James Brown was part of the &quot;Founding Stories&quot; phase of the UW Tacoma Oral History Project.,English,eng,University of Washington Tacoma Oral History: Founding Stories,UWTOH201809,"To request a high resolution or uncompressed reproduction, or to obtain permission to use any portion of this item, contact University of Washington Tacoma Library.

He begins by sharing his family history, tracing back to the early 1900s, when his grandparents immigrated and settled in today's downtown neighborhood of Tacoma, then a vibrant Japantown; his narration goes through World War II, when the residents were forced into internment, and into the mid-20th century. He recounts childhood memories living in the Japanese Language School building and participating in activities at the Tacoma Buddhist Temple, both of which were or are located on the present-day UW Tacoma campus. As an employee in multiple municipal offices from the late 1970s onward, Tanbara recalls discussions around a UW campus in Tacoma among local circles, including groups such as the Executive Council and individuals like Ryan Petty. At the end of the interview, Tanbara reflects on UW Tacoma's relationship with the neighborhood and local community, sharing his perspective on the university's role related to the history of Japantown and Tacoma.","Gregory Tanbara was born in Seattle, Washington, in 1953. He and his family moved to Tacoma when he was about two years old, and he has lived and worked in Tacoma almost his entire life.

His maternal family owned and took care of the Japanese Language School building before it was purchased by UW Tacoma in 1993. The building, now no longer standing, was a monument of the once-flourishing Japantown, which overlapped with the current footprint of the UW Tacoma campus. As a longtime resident of Tacoma, Tanbara has witnessed firsthand the transformation of the city over the past seven decades, as well as the community's investment in the establishment and growth of UW Tacoma.","Tanbara, Gregory M.--Interviews; Municipal employees--Washington (State)--Tacoma; Washington (State).
